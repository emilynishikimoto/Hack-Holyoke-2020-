# Hack-Holyoke-2020-
This project was done in 24 hours at HackHolyoke Hackathon 2020. Our goal was to create a COVID Tracking program that helps predict the number of cases on any given day given the current rate of spread. The program then reminds people to wear a mask to prevent more spread and deaths. We implemented this program first using command line and then in Django. Because we were learning Django in 24 hours, we ran into many bugs however we got a baseline to work. I hope to go back to this program and improve it to get it to function fully as well as possibly implement some type of API. 

HackHolyoke.py includes the command line program, the rest are part of the Django implementation. 
DEMO.mv includes a demo of both the command line and the Django programs.
